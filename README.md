Scenario: Product review is the most basic function/factor in resolvingcustomerissues and increasingthe sales growth of any product.We can understandtheir mindset toward our service withoutasking each customer.When consumers are unhappywith some aspect of a business, they reach out to customer service and might raise a complaint. Companiestry their best to resolve the complaints that they receive. However, it might not always be possible to appease every customer.So Here, we will analyze data, and with the help ofdifferent algorithms, we are finding the best classification ofcustomercategoryso thatwe can predict our test data.
Objective: Use Python libraries such as Pandas for data operations, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization and EDA tasks, Sklearn for model building and performance visualization, andbased on the best model,make a prediction for the test file and save the output.The mainobjective is to predict whetherour customer is disputedor not with the help ofgiven data.
